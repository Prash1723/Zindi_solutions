# Flight Delay Prediction Challenge

This Project was an online competition conducted on the zindi website. The challenge was to build a flight delay predictive model using Machine Learning techniques.

### Aim of the Project : 

The accurate prediction of flight delays will help all players in the air travel ecosystem to set up effective action plans to reduce the impact of the delays and avoid loss of time, capital and resources.
